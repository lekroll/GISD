# GISD Repository
German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD)

This repository contains data of the The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD). With GISD our aims were to develop a regional socioeconomic deprivation index for Germany that (1) can be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) provides a basis for explaining regional health differences in Germany. 

Originally the GISD data archive was submitted to [GESIS Datorium](https://datorium.gesis.org/xmlui/handle/10.7802/1460). 

**From now on, Updates on GISD will be provided by RKI at https://github.com/GISD-FG28/GISD**
