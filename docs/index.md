This repository contains data of the The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD). With GISD our aims were to develop a regional socioeconomic deprivation index for Germany that (1) can be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) provides a basis for explaining regional health differences in Germany. 

Originally the GISD data archive was submitted to [GESIS Datorium](https://datorium.gesis.org/xmlui/handle/10.7802/1460). But as we plan to update GISD anually when new data from [www.inkar.de](http://www.inkar.de) is available, it will be hosted at github.

If you need help with GISD please feel free to contact [FG 28 of RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Institut/OrgEinheiten/Abt2/FG28/fg28_node.html) or file an [Issue at GitHub](https://github.com/lekroll/GISD/issues).

For details see the [GISD Homepage](https://lekroll.github.io/GISD).

**Please note:**
*Currently, we do NOT advise to use the index Revision 2019 due to a limited comparability with the older revisions that we are investigating (with a currently limited capacity)*

## Background
The core data stem from the [INKAR](http://www.inkar.de) (indicators and maps on spatial and urban development in Germany and Europe) database compiled by Germanys Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development. Factor analysis is used for indexing and the weighting of indicators for the three dimensions of education, occupation and income. 
It is generated at the levels of associations of municipalities, administrative districts and administrative regions.The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation illustrates regional socioeconomic differences at different spatial levels and contributes to explaining regional health differences. 

This index is intended for use in research as well as by federal and federal state health reporting systems and should enable access to new sources of data for investigating the links between social inequalities and health in Germany.
